# DataBuilder

DataBuilder is a tool that automates data engineering pipelines. It optimizes the extracting of data from a database, uses a tool I created called SMART CLEAN to automatically transform your data (without getting into specifics and semantics), and supports real-time loading of data into a database.

Pipeline Visualizer:
Uses Directed Acyclic Graphs to visualize your ETL pipeline.

DataFraud Model:
After that, PyTorch and Sci-kit are used to detect fraudulent data based on real-world datasets with Gradient Boosting used for accuracy. Existing datasets on fraudulent data are used to train the DataFraud model with feedback loops for retraining.
